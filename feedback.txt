Game Notes

- Map is very open to exploits
  - Players will focus on exploits if given the oppurtunity
- Taylor: engine noises are quiet
- Car horn for some player interaction
- Game is too difficult or frustrating for some players, the second to last turn
  sometimes makes people quit, because of no checkpoint and not knowing
  that it is very close to the end
- Some new players followed the skipper off the cliff like lemmings
- Something asked for a smaller circuit
